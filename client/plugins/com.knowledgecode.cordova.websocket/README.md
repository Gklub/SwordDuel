# WebSocket for Android
WebSocket for Android is a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin that makes possible to use WebSocket (RFC 6455) on Android.  
This is using Jetty under the terms of the Apache License v2.0.  

## Requirements
 - Java 1.6 or higher  
 - Android 2.2 or higher (recommend 4.0 or higher)  
 - Cordova/PhoneGap 3.0.0 or higher  

The version for Cordova/Phonegap 2.x is [here](https://github.com/knowledgecode/WebSocket-for-Android/tree/2.x).

[1] Due to SSL issue with Android.  
[2] Supports Base64 encoded data only.  
[3] May work. But not tested.  
[4] WebSocket has been supported by WebView since Android 4.4. The native WebSocket of these devices are used in preference to this plugin.  

## Installing
Use the Cordova/PhoneGap Command-Line interface.  

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/knowledgecode/WebSocket-for-Android.git

or  

    phonegap plugin add https://github.com/knowledgecode/WebSocket-for-Android.git

## Usage
### WebSocket(url[, protocols, options])
The WebSocket(url, protocols, options) constructor takes one, two or three arguments. The first argument, url, specifies the URL to which to connect. The second, protocols, is either a string or an array of strings. The Third, options, is the unique argument of this plugin is object. Options details are as follows.  

    var options = {
        origin: 'websocket-is-fun.com',
        maxConnectTime: 20000,              // 20sec
        maxTextMessageSize: 32768,          // 32kb
        maxBinaryMessageSize: 32768         // 32kb
    };

All these parameters are omissible. The origin is set empty when omit it. The maxConnectTime is the wait time for connection. The default value is 20,000 milliseconds when omit it. The maxTextMessageSize and the maxBinaryMessageSize are receivable maximum size from server. The default values are 32,768 bytes when omit them.  

Now, simple codes are as follows.  

    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org');

    ws.onopen = function () {
        console.log('onopen');
        this.send('hello');         // send "hello" after connected
    };

    ws.onmessage = function (event) {
        console.log(event.data);    // will be "hello"
        this.close();
    };

    ws.onerror = function () {
        console.log('error occurred!');
    };

    ws.onclose = function (event) {
        console.log(event.code);
        console.log(event.reason);
    };

#### Notes
The second argument, protocols, cannot omit if set options.  
That is as follows.  

    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org', '', { origin: 'websocket-is-fun.com' });

### send(data[, asBinary])
Transmits data to the server over the WebSocket connection. The data takes a string, a blob, or an arraybuffer. The second argument, asBinary, is the unique argument of this plugin. Usually is not used.  
In Android 2.2 and 2.3, binary message cannot be sent because both blob and arraybuffer are not supported. However, can be sent by encoding in Base64.  

    var data = btoa(binaryString);  // encoded in Base64
    ws.send(data, true);            // If omit the second argument, this is sent as text message.

#### Notes
If receives binary message in Android 2.2 and 2.3, encodes them in base64.  

    ws.onmessage = function (event) {
        // For example, the receiving data can be used as data URI scheme.
        img.src = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + event.data;
    };

### close([code, reason])
Closes the WebSocket connection or connection attempt, if any.
